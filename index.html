    <p>Hello. My name is Dzmitry and I'm a junior frontend developer.
        I'm from Soligrsk, but now i live in Minsk.
        At school, I learned French. I speak English little bit, because I learned English myself.
        In 2009(two thousand nine)  I graduated from the Belarusian National Technical University with a degree in mining engineer.
        I like programming. In my childhood I had a "byte" computer. On it I typed 700 (seven hundred) lines to listen to 30 (thirty) seconds of Bach's melody.
        In technical school, I helped a informatics teacher develop assignments and find solutions for students.
        When I made my first money, I bought a computer. I was the first in technical school who made my diplom on a computer.
        At the institute, I made money selling computers and components.With this money I bought my first car.
        After graduation, I worked as a mining foreman. Created his own truck company. 
        After the crisis I closed my company.
        I planted a tree, build a house and have two sons.
        My life was connected with computers and I liked it. I want to do what I love.
        I like the Python programming language. 
        I learned Python on stepik. I have several successful jobs on UpWork.These works are related to html, css and wordpress.
        From my own experience, I realized that a training program is needed.
        Now I am studying frontend at rs school. 
        I like my wife, sons and progrmming.
        And I'm not going to stop there...
        Thank you.</p>
